# Freedom Stack

A modern, type-safe web development stack using Astro, TypeScript, HTMX, Alpine.js, and more.

> [!TIP] 💡
> [Turso](https://tur.so/freedomstack) has a generous free tier for database hosting and management. And, when it's time to scale, use the code `FREEDOMSTACK` for a discount on paid plans.

## Get Started 🚀

### 1. Create Your Project

You can create a new Freedom Stack project using npm:

```bash
# Create a new project
npx create-freedom-stack my-app

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my-app

# Set up your database
npm run db:setup

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Your development server will be running on [`localhost:4321`](http://localhost:4321).

### 2. Environment Variables

The project will automatically create a `.env` file with a generated `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. You'll need to set these additional variables:

```env
# Astro DB - LibSQL (required) - Your database
ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL=""    # Added by npm run db:setup
ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN=""     # Added by npm run db:setup

# Better Auth (required)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=""     # Auto-generated during setup
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:4321"
```

### 3. Have fun!

Create because you love creating. Make development fun again!

# Freedom Stack • Full-Stack Starter Kit

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/78803fc4-5d36-4efb-82cd-2daeb5684fb6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/freedom-stack/deploys) [![Github Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/cameronapak/freedom-stack?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/cameronapak/freedom-stack/stargazers)

An Astro-based full-stack starter kit that feels freeing, and is free. Make development fun again. [See the demo site](https://freedom.faith.tools).

I wanted to provide a stack that's powerful like Ruby on Rails _("The One Person Framework")_, but with the ease and "vanilla" web dev feel of Astro.

## Learning Resources 📚

### The Frontend Layer

If you want to learn more about the frontend layer, I recommend the [Astro Web Framework Crash Course by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-hTm5VmofI).

### The Interactivity Layer

If you want to learn more about Alpine.js, I recommend [Learn Alpine.js on codecourse](https://codecourse.com/courses/learn-alpine-js).

### The Database Layer

If you want to learn more about the database layer, I recommend learning from [High Performance SQLite course](https://highperformancesqlite.com/), sponsored by [Turso](https://tur.so/freedomstack/).

### The Philosophy Layer

A starter kit like this can save hours, days, or even weeks of development time. However, it's not enough just to have the baseline. You will need to have a philosophy around building a site or web app, so that you can make the most of the tooling and minimize wasting time. I recommend reading Getting Real by 37signals. [It's free to read online](https://books.37signals.com/8/getting-real). _(While the book says a few choice words, it's a great, practical resource for building great software.)_

## Here's What's Included 🔋🔋🔋

Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. Parfaits have layers. And, Freedom Stack has layers!

### UI Layer

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - A simple web metaframework.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling.
- [Preline UI](https://preline.co/) - Tailwind-based HTML components.
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) - For a Bootstrap-like UI CSS component
  library, built upon Tailwind.
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) - For a beautiful icon library.

### Interactivity Layer

- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - Use your database without having to know or worry about SQL syntax.
- [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/) - For authentication.

### Bonus Layer

- A well-prompted `.cursorrules` file for [Cursor's AI IDE](https://cursor.com/) to be a friendly guide helping you using this stack easier.

## Vision ❤️

I dream of a lightweight, simple web development stack that invokes a fun web
experience at the cheapest possible maintainance, backend, and server cost. As
close to free as possible.

### Core Principles

- **Approachable** — I want those new to web development to feel comfortable
  using this stack. Things like database management should feel intuitive.
  Remove barriers of traditional JavaScript frameworks, such as excessive
  boilerplate code or intense state management. Go back to the basics of web
  development. (_While this is not vanilla, the dev experience will feel very
  natural._)
- **Flow-able** — Use an HTML-first approach, where almost all of the work is
  done on the DOM layer: styling, structuring, and interactivity. An opinionated
  stack helps you avoid analysis paralysis of trying to decide what tooling to
  pick or how to put things together. Instead, spend your thinking time
  building. This simple stack helps you focus and get in the flow of code
  faster. Fast setup. Fast building. Fast shipping.
- **Pocket-friendly** — Using this stack will be financially maintainable to
  anyone, especially indie hackers and those creating startup sites / web apps.
